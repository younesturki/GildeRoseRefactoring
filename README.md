# The Gilded Rose Code Kata
This is a Java version of the Gilded Rose Kata, to find the code of the exercice you can go to this github below.

  https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.

This is a refactorying kata, so you will be starting with a legacy code base. To work the Kata, clone this git repository and checkout the tag 'start-here'. Read the description below for the "rules" involving this kata.

# Changes from the original
This Java version follows the original code very closely, but has the following changes:

The original had no tests. Since this is a refactoring kata, I feel the tests are important and provide a fairly complete test suite. Just delete the tests if you wish to "go it alone".

I took first of all the original code, I had some tests to use them during my refactoring, after that when I was doing the refactoring I was checking if I didn't break the original code by checking the Test each time.
You can read the original kata article for more details.
